## Approach:

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Use auto EDA tools like pandas_profiling or sweetviz.
Visualize distributions, correlations, and missing values.
Identify outliers and anomalies.

### 2. Data Preprocessing and Cleaning:
Handle missing values using imputation techniques.
Normalize and standardize data.
Feature engineering based on domain knowledge.
Feature selection using techniques like recursive feature elimination or correlation analysis.
Address class imbalance using techniques like SMOTE, ADASYN, or random undersampling/oversampling.

### 3. Clustering and Anomaly Detection:
Apply clustering algorithms like KMeans / DBSCAN.
Use anomaly detection techniques like Isolation Forest or One-Class SVM.

### 4. Machine Learning Models and AutoML:
Utilize platforms like Azure ML / AWS SageMaker.
Build models such as Decision Trees, Random Forests, Neural Networks, etc.
Evaluate models using appropriate metrics.
Apply ensemble techniques for improved performance.

## Tools & Libraries:
Python
pandas, numpy
scikit-learn
TensorFlow, Keras
Azure ML, AWS SageMaker

## Conclusion:
This project aims to provide a comprehensive approach to handling diverse datasets, from the initial stages of EDA to the final modeling. By addressing the unique challenges posed by each dataset type and nature (balanced/imbalanced), we strive for accurate and insightful results.
